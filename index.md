The objective of the **Universal Anaphora Initiative** is to enable further progress in the empirical study of anaphora by covering not just coreference, but all aspects of anaphoric interpretation from identity of sense anaphora to bridging to discourse deixis (although not all anaphorically annotated corpora  cover all of these phenomena); and not just English, but all languages. 

## Background

Thanks to recent advances in NLP and representation learning, interest in co-reference resolution and related tasks is at a high point. At the same time, large scale resources are still only available for few languages, and languages with multiple resources (notably English) do not employ a uniform standard, neither in terms of annotation formats, nor in terms of guidelines. These defecits are crucial to address as we move towards broader coverage of languages and text types, as well as work on multilingual and reusable tools for different types of anaphora. 

Showing a blueprint for a way forward, the **Universal Dependencies Initiative** has been very successful at progressively developing agreed upon standards concerning the annotation and markup of syntactic dependency information across multiple languages and domains. The long-term objective of the UD-inspired **Universal Anaphora Initiative** is to do the same for anaphoric information. 

## Objective

The more modest objective of the first stage of the **Universal Anaphora Initiative** is to come up with an agreed-upon _markup scheme_ that can be used to encode the information in the existing corpora, which will enable us to create a collection of corpora all encoded using the same scheme. 
But we hope that this exercise will prove a useful starting point for further discussion on the annotation schemes, as well. 

A unified markup scheme hopefully will also allow us to develop an extension of the CONLL scorer able to score not just _identity anaphora_, but also other aspects of anaphoric interpretation such as the identification of _non-referring expressions_, as done in the 2018 CRAC Shared Task, as well as bridging reference and discourse deixis resolution.

We are fully aware that there is at the moment only partial agreement on the  anaphoric phenomena that should be covered by such a scheme, and on the details of how they should be annotated. We will therefore adopt a similar strategy to that adopted in the MATE proposal (Poesio et al., 1999) - namely, identify those aspects of the proposal which are core and those that are optional.
